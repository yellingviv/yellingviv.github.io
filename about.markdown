Vivienne is a security engineer focused on vulnerability management, and a student in the part-time software engineering fellowship at Hackbright Academy.

She likes Python (and love/hates Node), command line craftery, and hiding out on the back-end. Please don't make her do FE. (Thanks, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), for making this website possible with as little FE work as possible.) Her ideal job is writing internal tools to help streamline security and make it easy for users to follow security best practices without pain and frustration.

Care and feeding of a Viv: a quiet corner with ample blankets, coffee, snacks, and lots of animals.
