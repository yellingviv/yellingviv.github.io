## I'm just a nerd, standing in front of the internet, asking it to care about security.

I'm passionate about internal network and infrastructure security, security by design, and software and automation development to make security the easiest choice. I love malware reverse engineering and secure software forward engineering :) I am looking for opportunities to learn more about forensics, network traffic analysis, and detection and response.

*I am also very passionate about pair programming with animals.*
